          <h3> Instructions </h3>
  <!--  ordered list  -->
          <ol>
              <li> Gather all ingredients and preheat oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit</li>
              <li> Greese a 9x5-inch loaf pan</li>
              <li> Mash the bananas inside a large bowl </li>
              <li> Add in the rest of the wet ingredients into the bowl, such as the eggs, melted butter, vanilla extract (if added), etc</li>
              <li> In another bowl, mix the dry ingredients together: flour, baking soda, salt, sugar, nuts, chocolate chips, etc</li>
              <li> Once both bowls are mixed, conjoin the dry and wet mixtures until the batter is mixed evenly throughout</li>
              <li> Pour the combined batter into the greesed baking platter</li>
              <li> Bake in the oven for about an hour-- the loaf should be golden crusted and fully baked inside. <br/> To check whether it is ready, you can use a toothpick and insert it through the loaf. If the toothpick comes out clean, the bread is ready! </li>
              <li> Take out the bread and let it sit for about 10-15 minutes to cool down and settle</li>
              <li> Serve and enjoy your creation! </li>
