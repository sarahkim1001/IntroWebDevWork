A quick note on the article on wireframing...

Wireframing is a fundamental process in communication with other teams and developments in design. 
User experience problems are multifaceted, needing to consider the purpose/ objective of the project,
the problem it it solving, the recipient of the product, and the destination of the tool/ page. 

Drawing out the workflow in sketches can leave time for discussion on how the design can be improved
for its purpose and useability. Feedback is another crucial element to refining the design to catch 
unforeseen capabilities. 

Getting familiar with helpful tools dedicated for the development of low and high fidelity wireframes 
can help save time and make the job more simple in the long run. 

Know your audience when developing the project, since knowledge and communication varies amongst 
different teams. Think of effective ways of communicating a message to a specific role and team.
