      <p>
        Although propaganda is regarded as a modern term, closely associated with the instances of poster propaganda distributed throughout the West in World War I and World War II, the essence of propaganda can be traced back to the Ancient Civilizations. Propaganda has morphed through many forms, conveying itself through communication systems and mass media technologies concurrent to its day and age. Created with the intent to suppose an idea/ truth consequently shaping social and cultural attitudes, propaganda has the power to subject the masses to a system of belief or framework of thought.

            <p class="theMeat"> The image displays Pharaoh Ramesses II smiting his enemies, a position that expresses victory over enemies. The image of Egyptian kings in the smiting position was found to be a theme traditioned in Egyptian works and art, including inscriptions on stone, tracing back to the First Dyansty. The limestone fragment shows a painted Ramssess II holding the heads of foreign enemies in this case: The Nubians, the Libyans and the Syrians. With the use of written texts and inscription, two-dimensional representations, and staturary, the Egyptians were able to covey particular messages to their population. Messages would shape ideology by creating works that would perpetuate the power, victory, divinely and inherent authority of the pharoah.  </p>

            <p class="theMeat"> Pharoah Merneptah, the son of King Ramesses II, ruled Egypt in the late 13th century BCE. The stone monolith Merneptah Stela, which stands at seven and a half feet, inscribes Merneptah's military victories in Africa and the Near East. The stone carving was discovered during an escavation in Thebes, Greece in the year 1896. The stone is significant biblically as it mentions the nation of Israel, as one of the defeated states. In one line of the lengthy insription, Israel is mentioned 'Israel is wasted, bare of seed.' The work was comissioned by the pharoah himself to celebrate his military success, perpetuating his victory, glory, and power. Merneptah Stela is currently located in the Cairo Museum in Egypt.

            <p class="theMeat"> As part of the Macedonian Royal Family, Alexander the Great was claimed to be a descendent of Herakles, and Zeus. Alexander rose to power at the age of 20 in 336 BCE after the assassination of his father. Alexander rose to expand and establish a vast empire, from Macedonia to Persia, Asia Minor, Egypt, and Mesopotamia through his military conquests, in result, diffusing Hellenistic culture and establishing a colonial order in the defeated territories. Tetradrachm coins were minted during and after Alexander's lifetime. Imprinted on one side of the coin, the profile of Herkales wearing the headress of a lion. The flipside shows an icon of Zeus and an inscription of Alexander. These coins propagate the notion of the inherent and divinely authority of the royal family.

            <p class="theMeat"> In 44 BCE Julius Caesar declared himself the dictator for life of the Roman Empire as a military general and politian. During his reign, Caesar used his position to create government reforms and enlarge the senate. Caesar gained power and victories in his military conquests such as during the Gallic Wars from 58 to 50 BCE. Several coins were manufactured to symbolize his absolute power and values in sophistication throughout the stat. Julius Caesar was the first Roman subject to have his coin produced during his lifetime. Caesar's rise and hunger for absolute power agitated the senators, some of whom eventually assassinated Caesar by stabbing him to death in the house of the Senate. A coin was minted by Marcus Junius Brutus following his death, known as Eid Mar, to celebrate his assasination and the fall of the tyrant.

            <p class="theMeat"> It wasn't until the advent of the printing press in 1440, which allowed for the mass production of print material, where propaganda was able to be more widely distributed in the paper medium. Martin Luther, German monk and theologian, used the printing press to disseminate his ideas and critique on the Roman Catholic Church during the Protestant Reformation in 1517. The movement rejected the authority and curruption of state of the Catholic Church. Martin Luther and Philipp Melanchthon comissioned the illustration of the pope as part donkey, fish, etc, to Lucas Cranach the Elder. The image used in a line of pamphlets against the Roman Catholic Chruch. The Protestant Reformation swept across Europe in the 16th century, resulting in the formation of the Protestantism demonation in the Christian practice and religion.   </p>
