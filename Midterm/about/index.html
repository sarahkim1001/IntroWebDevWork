        <h3 class="aboutHead">origins of propaganda</h3>
        <p class="aboutMe">Although propaganda is regarded as a modern term, closely associated with the instances of poster propaganda distributed throughout the West in World War I and World War II, propaganda can be traced back to the Ancient Civilizations, such as Ancient Greece and Ancient Egypt. Propaganda has morphed through many forms, conveying itself through communication systems and mass media technologies concurrent to its day and age. Created with the intent to suppose an idea/ truth or to shape social and cultural attitudes, propaganda has the power to subject the masses to a system of belief or framework of thought. Administrative systems can be considered to have utilized this system of imprinting and inscription to support their legitimacy and to engrave their “divinely” authority by circulating iconic symbols and themes through visual communication forms such as art, stone-carvings, currency, literature, films and images.
          It was only until the advent of the Gutenberg printing press in 1440, which allowed for the mass production of uniform matter using a system of movable type, when propaganda could be accessible to a broader audience for a lower cost. The term propaganda apparently first came to common use as a result of missionary activities of the Catholic Church in the early 17th century with the creation of the Congregation for the Propagation of Faith, in which Pope Gregory XV commissioned cardinals to convert the indigenous population in the Western pagan lands by spreading materials and ideas in support of the Christian faith. Since propaganda was inherently intertwined with religious affairs and institutions, it was regarded with respect and honor, however the connotation of the word has changed with the progression of time and circumstances. 
          Counter-culture political movements, such as the Protestant Reformation in 1517, the Western Anarchist movements from 1880 through 1920 have also employed the use of propaganda to disseminate their beliefs and messages, often portrayed as a critique of the current form of government and state institution or conversely emphasizing the power of the common person.
